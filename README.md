## Assignments

### Assignment 01 - Hello World

In this assignment I change the TextView of the tutorial exercise from "Hello World" to "DAVIDE GRANDESSO". Then I add two other TextView, in the first one I write “My favorite color is red” and I change the text color to red, in the last TextView I write “My favorite sport is football”.

### Assignment 02 - Material Design

In this assignment I implemented a button labeled "Count" and I count how many times the user click this button, if the goal is reached then the app prints a "Congratulations" toast message

Other implementation:

- Circular Progress Indicator increase with the count number
- Reset to 0
- Change the icon of the app.
- Counter restart

### Assignment 03 - Step Detector & DB

In this assignment the app can automatically detect steps and save them in a database.

It is also possible to see how many steps the user took on different days of that week.

Other implementation:

- `countSteps()` & `STEP_DETECTOR`
- Update the Circular Progress Bar
- Data storage and visualization
